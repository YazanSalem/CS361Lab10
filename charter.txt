Group Charter: Your Team Name  

Meeting Ground Rules:
 Meetings will be normally scheduled at 6:45 PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. All members are expected to attend each meeting unless there is a scheduling conflict. 
If there is a conflict the group member should inform the group twenty four hours in advance. 
Given that there is only six weeks left in the semester, scheduling conflicts should be kept to an absolute minimum.
If the meeting schedule needs to change it will be discussed and agreed to as a group.

  Meeting time is valuable and therefore everyone should be on time, mentally present, and engaged. 
 This means there should be no outside work brought to the meetings, and phones should only be used to inform people outside the group that the member is currently engaged.
Emergencies that require immediate attention are acceptable, however if they become a problem the issues will be discussed as a group and a collective decision will be arrived at as to how to proceed. 
If a member violates these norms repeatedly it will be dealt with as outlined in the disciplinary section below.

  The meetings will take place over Microsoft Teams. 
 Each meeting will follow the Scrum framework.
 At every meeting the group will address what each member has accomplished, what each member plans to accomplish before the next meeting, and the challenges each member is facing. 
Meetings should be as long as needed to keep every group member informed, and no longer. 
Meeting length will vary with the needs of the project but should be kept to less than an hour. 
If more time is needed for individual members, they should schedule time to work together outside of regular meeting time.

Group participation and work quality 

1. Group participation: 

	Given a group members participation of work, they may be asked to share more of their workload or less based on the situation. Everyone should be cognizant of meetings, along with actively helping the flow of meetings. If someone is asked to share what is on their mind or asked to give others a chance to speak but do not, and their participation in a conversation is blocking the flow of a meeting, then it could be considered as an infraction.

2. Work not up to standard: 

There is a standard that we should all uphold if we want to succeed. We should strive for quality of work, timeliness of work, and respect for our fellow group members. Everyone gets inundated with work on occasion and it’s understandable that at periods, someone may not be able to give their full effort given what we agreed upon. If this happens, said group member who is having issues must keep in contact with the rest of the group so the task can be redistributed, using what our group established in decisions and delegation. Hopefully this will help the group continue functioning efficiently. If the individual is consistently having issues with following our group standard, it could be considered be considered a major offense.


3. Group members unprepared: 

Everyone has their own life and schedule, filled with things they must do. If the group visibly notices a member is under prepared, or not prepared at all consistently, then it may be considered a minor offense.

4. Workload too heavy: 

	If the time restraints or lack of individuals working to complete a task is not sufficient, we as a group will work on an e-mail to send to Jayson (or in person if we can be on campus) which logs the details of the amount of work to be done, the status of how far we are as a group, and the reasoning as to why we can’t complete it in the given time period.


Disciplinary Procedures

1: If the group collectively agrees to waive any disciplinary action as outlined in this document, they can do so via means of a majority vote. If the group votes on this,
every member apart from the offending party must be present.

2: A disciplinary log will be kept to keep track of any offences commited by group members. This log will be primarily the responsibility of one group member,
but everyone should have permission to edit as long as the edits are reviewed by group members.

3: A minor offence will be considered anything that is in violotion of the group policies outlined in this charter in what the group considers a minor fashion. 
Minor offences must be logged, ensuring to note down what the offence entailed and when it was commited. A minor offence shall result in notification of the 
offence to the group member that will act as a warning. If the behavior does not change, a minor offence may be upgraded to a higher level.

4: A major offence will be considered anything that is in violation of the group policies outlined in this charter in what the group considers a major fashion,
or if a group member accrues three minor offences. After a major offence, the group member will be considered to be on probation, which they will be alerted about
via a detailed email. A group member on probation cannot participate in a majority vote as outlined in the first point of this section and any further offences, 
be they major or minor, they may become a candidate forformal punishment or even perhaps dismissal. A member's probation status can be ended upon a majority vote
as outlined in the first point in this section.

5: When someone becomes a candidate for punishment or dismissal, a detailed list of offences leading up to the group's decision will be sent to the TA and Professor Rock,
along with messages from at least two other group members outlining their personal experience with the person in question. At that point, if the TA and Professor Rock deem
that the group member is to be removed, all of the member's contributions will be taken and their remaining work distributed among the rest of the group members.

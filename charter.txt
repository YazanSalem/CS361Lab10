Disciplinary Procedures

1: If the group collectively agrees to waive any disciplinary action as outlined in this document, they can do so via means of a majority vote. If the group votes on this,
every member apart from the offending party must be present.

2: A disciplinary log will be kept to keep track of any offences commited by group members. This log will be primarily the responsibility of one group member,
but everyone should have permission to edit as long as the edits are reviewed by group members.

3: A minor offence will be considered anything that is in violotion of the group policies outlined in this charter in what the group considers a minor fashion. 
Minor offences must be logged, ensuring to note down what the offence entailed and when it was commited. A minor offence shall result in notification of the 
offence to the group member that will act as a warning. If the behavior does not change, a minor offence may be upgraded to a higher level.

4: A major offence will be considered anything that is in violation of the group policies outlined in this charter in what the group considers a major fashion,
or if a group member accrues three minor offences. After a major offence, the group member will be considered to be on probation, which they will be alerted about
via a detailed email. A group member on probation cannot participate in a majority vote as outlined in the first point of this section and any further offences, 
be they major or minor, they may become a candidate forformal punishment or even perhaps dismissal. A member's probation status can be ended upon a majority vote
as outlined in the first point in this section.

5: When someone becomes a candidate for punishment or dismissal, a detailed list of offences leading up to the group's decision will be sent to the TA and Professor Rock,
along with messages from at least two other group members outlining their personal experience with the person in question. At that point, if the TA and Professor Rock deem
that the group member is to be removed, all of the member's contributions will be taken and their remaining work distributed among the rest of the group members.

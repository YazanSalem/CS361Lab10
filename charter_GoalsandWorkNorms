Work Norms: 

1)	Time Commitment:
The goal for each member should be to complete the task that they are assigned, it would be very difficult to assign a specfic time to each task that has to be done.
Therefore, If that individual spends adequate time on a task and is struggling, it is that individuals responsiblity to reach out to other group members and seek guidance on what they are struggling on.
If there is a group member that is struggling to complete their task, it is the groups job to pivot and provide help or determine whether that individual’s workload should be decreased.

2)	Quality Work
a.	The goal for each member should be to produce quality code that accomplishes the task that the individual is assigned to do. 
If that individual doesn’t reach out for help or produce a quality product, then the procedures for dealing with that individual are in the ground rules.
